This is a simple Event RSVP Management App taken from the <b>Rails 4 Application Development book</b>.

Compared with the original tutorial, this version features improved design with Bootstrap. It also adds several controller and model tests with MiniTest, as well as integration tests with Capybara. The app is not tested extensively, but the tests cover the most important features. All the typos and bugs present in the tutorial code have been fixed.

To run:
<code>bundle install</code>
<code>rake db:create</code>
<code>rake db:migrate</code>

The project is built with Rails 4.1.1 and PostgreSQL database.
